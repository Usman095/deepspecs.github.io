## Training SpeCollate can someone deploy this?

SpeCollate is trained on tuples of six datapoints, i.e., the anchor spectrum, the positive peptide, two negative peptides, and two negative spectra. The objective function is designed to project the positive pair closer to each other than the remaining negative peptides and spectra. To avoid overfitting, the negative examples are chosen dynamically after each positive pass through the network such that they are closest to the positive pair. Details of the training process can be found in the training section of the paper.

Here we will show the UMAP projections of the embedded spectra and peptides generated by the trained network.

In Fig 1, mappings of spectra and peptide embeddings from NIST Library Human-HCD-Phospho are shown at mass 2000 Da. Peptides are shown in red points, and the clustering of the blue points around the peptide (red point) represents the spectra belonging to that peptide.
